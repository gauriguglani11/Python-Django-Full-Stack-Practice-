    <p id="three">A startup or start-up is a company started by an entrepreneur to seek, effectively develop, and validate a scalable business model.
      While entrepreneurship refers to all new businesses, including self-employment and businesses that never intend to become registered,
      startups refer to the new businesses that intend to grow large beyond the solo founder.[3] Startups face high uncertainty and
      have high rates of failure, but a minority of them do go on to be successful and influential.Some startups become unicorns, i.e.
      privately held startup companies valued at over US$1 billion.</p>

Lean startup is a popular set of principles to create and design startups under limited resources and tremendous uncertainty to
build their ventures more flexibly and at lower cost. It is based on the idea that entrepreneurs can make their implicit assumptions
about how their venture works explicit and empirically testing it.The empirical tests is to de/validate these assumptions and to
get an engaged understanding of the business model of the new ventures, and in doing so, the new ventures are created iteratively in a
build–measure–learn loop. Hence, lean startup is a set of principles for entrepreneurial learning and business model design. More precisely,
it is a set of design principles aimed for iteratively experiential learning under uncertainty in an engaged empirical manner. Typically,
lean startup focuses on a few lean principles:
find a problem worth solving, then define a solution
engage early adopters for market validation
continually test with smaller, faster iterations
build a function, measure customer response, and verify/refute the idea
evidence-based decisions on when to "pivot" by changing your plan's course
maximize the efforts for speed, learning, and focus</p>
